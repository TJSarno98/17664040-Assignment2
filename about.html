            A longstanding love affair with all things 80's and a chance encounter with a Dukes of Hazzard T-Shirt were responsible for the start of all things TruffleShuffle. After bringing said T-Shirt back from the US of A, our founder proudly wore it to the pub and after getting tonnes of comments from his fellow revellers, came up with the idea for a site which was dedicated to all things retro. We decided to name ourselves after the famous dance from another 80's classic, The Goonies and 11 Years and many, many T-Shirts (not to mention all the funky gifts, accessories and other retro bits and bobs we offer too!) later, we've never looked back. Run by a clutch of 80's kids (and a couple of 60's and 70's kids!) we absolutely love what we do and we hope you do too.

            We are always keeping our eyes and ears to the ground, looking for the best retro treats for you guys, our lovely customers! We source our old school gear from all over the world, from suppliers big and small and usually in limited numbers so you can ensure whatever you buy from us stays individual and original. That does mean though that if you see something you like, we recommend that you snap it up quick as it might not be around for long. We are also proud to say that everything you see on the site is officially licensed so for example, Ian Allen AKA Mr Spoon personally approved our Button Moon Range, Debbie Harry did the same with our Blondie tees and Warner Brothers did the same with our Goonies goodies.. the list goes on and on! That also means that you can rest assured that anything you buy from us is top quality merchandise. Most importantly, you – our lovely customers – are at the centre of what we do! Whether it's suggestions for new ranges, improvements to the site, new styles you want to see.... we love getting your feedback and always do our best to act on it. Tonnes of our product is on the site because customers like you said they wanted it (The Racoons, Clueless, Top Gun to name but a few!) so get involved either by emailing us, calling us or dropping us a line through our Facebook or Twitter pages as we love hearing from you!
